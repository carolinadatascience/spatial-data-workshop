<h1 align="center">Spatial Data with Python Workshop</h1>

<p align="center"><b><i>Created by <a href="https://github.com/amitparikh1">Amit Parikh</a> for Carolina Analytics and Data Science on 3/1/2023</b></i></p>

 
**Spatial Data** can be defined as any series of data that has an implicit or explicit association with a geographic location. Spatial data is all around us and is constantly being collected. 

In this workshop we will go over some common examples of spatial datasets, data types that are specific to spatial data, how to best analyze spatial data in Python using GeoPandas, and explore ways we can visualize spatial data. 

This workshop is meant to be **introductory** and is open to all skill levels. A basic understanding of Python and Pandas would be helpful, but not necessary. To familiarize yourself with Python and Pandas, check out our <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtOYSqZWWG7L1tUaEgUwtJP0d9xYHN7o1"> CADS intro YouTube series </a>. 

## Getting Started

Here are some of the things you must do to get started with this workshop:

### Software Prerequisites

#### Programming Interface
##### Option 1 (Run Locally)
- **This workshop uses the Python programming language.** If you do not already have Python installed on your computer, install the latest version for your operating system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- This workshop will also use JupyterLab to run Jupyter Notebooks (with Python). Learn how to install JupyterLab [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
##### Option 2 (Google CoLab - Beginner Friendly)
- You can follow along in your browser by going to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">colab.research.google.com</a>. 
- Navigate to the GitHub tab
- Enter the URL of this repository into the workshop. https://github.com/carolinadatascience/spatial-data-workshop
- Select and open the notebook to follow along

#### Packages
- This workshop heavily uses the `geopandas` package for Python. To install this, create a new cell in your JupyterLab Notebook file and type the following command:
    ```bash
    !pip install geopandas
    ```

    Running that cell in JupyterLab should install this package for you.
    
### Clone this Repository

To download the code of this workshop on your device, you need to clone this repository to your computer.

If you are not familiar with how to use GitHub, using **GitHub Desktop** is an easy way to interact with and manage your repositories. Download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com), and feel free to follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) tutorial to clone this repo to your computer.

### Download the Data

This section is optional, however it is needed when you have large datasets that must either be downloaded or accessed and is not already included in the repository. Provide a description of the dataset, a link to it, and attribution here.

## Content Section

Feel free to add anything you feel to be important in this section. This could be nothing, although you are encouraged you add explanations here if needed!
